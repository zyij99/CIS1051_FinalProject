# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

AnimeBot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a bot that allows people to search for anime titles, get update on anime news, play anime songs, and get redirected to a webpage where they can watch an anime, give anime recommendations.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My discord bot will update on the lastest anime news, conventions, voice actors, and pretty much anything that is anime related and is considered popular. If possible, I plan on using MyAnimeList's API (if possible) to create this bot. Aside from automatic posts about anime news, the bot will also be able to allow users to search specific animes without leaving discord by using a '!search' command. If possible I would also like for my bot to be able to play anime music using a '!song' command and also create links redirecting to where they can watch an anime (crunchyroll/funimation) using a '!watch' command. Lastly, I would like for my bot to be able to reccomend animes for people who can not decide on something to watch.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think a good outcome for my project is if I can create the bot and get it to do at least one of the intended functions wether it be anime news notifications, searching for an anime's MAL page, playing music, reccomending anime, or redirecting to the webpage on crunchyroll or funimate where someone can watch an anime.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think a better outcome for my project is if I can implement 2 of 5 of the intended functions, I think I should be able to accomplish at least the functions of the bot where it uses commands, but unsure if i'll be able to do the news part of the project.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is if everything is accomplished, but I really doubt that would happen... So if being somewhat realistic I want to be able to finish all the commands within the allotted time.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn to make a discord bot, how to impliment commands, how to access data from the web. I will need to aquire pretty much everything for this project as I am going in completely blind as I have never done anything like this before.
