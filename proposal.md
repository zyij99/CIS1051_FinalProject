# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

image_bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a bot that allows discord users to store any image on the discord bot's directory as long as they have the discord generated url.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My discord bot will allow users to upload images and store them in the bot's directory for later use. The bot will have commands to allow the user to call for a random image or a specific image if the user remembers the number associated with the image. By uploading a image on to the directory, the bot will respond with the image and the image number in case the user wants to call forth the image at a later date. If not, the image can be called in a random image command which will also reveal the image number.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think a good outcome for my project is if I can create the bot and have it functioning. Regardless of what happens, I should be able to make the bot save uploaded images onto it's directory and be able to call those images.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think a better outcome for my project is if I can somehow sort and create multiple folders within the file. ie. a command specificially for memes, for pet pictures, etc.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is if I am able to find a way to sort it and read all the information for the pictures. Perhaps maybe even implement some sort of API from reddit or something that could import memes and allow users to save the ones they like. I would also want to be able to create pet profile cards and allow users to add descriptions of their pets.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn to make a discord bot, how to impliment commands, how to access data from the web, and refesh myself on file reading. I will need to aquire pretty much everything for this project as I am going in completely blind as I have never done anything like this before. There will be a lot of reading, tutorial watching, and figuring out how to implement different things with the stuff I currently know to create a project that matches my current skill level.

Update: Changed ideas, but still doing discord bot. Realized might run into some ToS issues if I did a Anime Bot that also acts as a youtube music player without the ads.
