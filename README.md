Difficulties faced/overcame:
A difficulty I faced was learning how to store images and call them. I combined what I learned in class (file reading) with what I was able to find online about saving images to the discord bot directory. By storing the .jpg files inside of text files I was able to store them into dictionaries which made it easier to call them using the msg.send(file = discord.File('... .jpg') because they were assignmed numbers or the key values as they are saved. Another difficulty I faced was using github. I'm pretty new to this so I didn't know how to keep everything updated, so instead I used just 1 main python file with all my work rather than splitting it up into multiple files and using __init__ and other things, which can be seen in the embed section, where I made my own custom help commands.

Things I learned:
I learned how to use 'Try', 'Except', global variables, as well as the print equilivalent of a discord bot (await). Although it is not in my project, I did learned a bit about Cogs and subclasses when doing research. I also learned a few new things about the discord module and how importing and to use pip install. One of the first things I came across when learning to make my bot is how to create a .env file and what it does alongside with .gitignore.

What I enjoyed:
I enjoyed playing around and experimenting with the bot once I had some sort of momentum, but at first it took a while to learn it and was not as enjoyable. I tried to combine stuff I learned in class with my newfound knowledge aquired through research to create a bot that currently represents what I am able to do.
