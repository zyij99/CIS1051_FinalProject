# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Phone app (something like slither.io?), learn to make a discord bot (Not sure yet), a game (maybe something like blackjack?)

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No collaboration (probably)

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is the final project going to be graded based on it's complexity and appearance?
