Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have done some research on how to create a discord bot in both js and python. I have also complied a list of resources to refer to when implementing commands. It is very likely that I will code the bot using python. I have the bot set up and a discord sever for testing the bot, but still have to figure out how to code various commands and stuff I would like the bot to do.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not figured out how to sort images and create profile cards. I have not started researching the other commands that I was hoping to have after the initial part is set up.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Had to change bot project ideas cause I realized there might be some issues with my previous idea.
I am not sure how to upload multiple images at once and save them all to dir.
